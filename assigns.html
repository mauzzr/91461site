<h3>Assignment 1</h3>
<p>
    No work was submitted for Assignment 1, as it only entailed configuring my personal machines
    for the purposes of this course. I have a working installation of XAMPP, and I have elected to use
    WebStorm in lieu of NetBeans as my IDE of choice.

<h3>Assignment 2</h3>
<p>
    Assignment 2 was the assignment for which this page was created. I implemented a simple single-page
    navigation system and gave it some basic styling in CSS.

<h3>Assignment 3</h3>
<p>
    Assignment 3 comprised a small handful of updates to this page. I reformatted this Assignments content
    section and added a new CSS rule (via a child selector) to facilitate the assignment section headings.
